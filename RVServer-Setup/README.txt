RUMBLEVERSE SERVER SETUP - host your own server
================================================

Two kinds of server, one setup tool:

  PRIVATE SERVER  - you + your friends. Runs on your own PC. Friends join over Tailscale or
                    Radmin VPN. Nobody else sees it, and it is never in public matchmaking.
  COMMUNITY SERVER - public. Runs on a VPS or dedicated server. After we approve it, it joins
                    matchmaking for everyone in your region, shown as "Community" in the launcher.

Setup picks the right one for you: on a home internet connection it always sets up a PRIVATE
server (public servers need a VPS or dedicated server).

WHAT YOU NEED
  - Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2019+, 64-bit
  - YOUR OWN copy of Rumbleverse (we never provide game files). Setup finds the one your
    rVclient launcher uses.
  - RAM: about 2 GB for each server (memory saving is on by default). A community server runs
    TWO servers per Battle Royale mode (the warm spare - see below), so about 4 GB per mode; the
    spare only starts when 2.5 GB are free. A private server runs one server per mode.
  - Disk: about 15 GB if setup copies your game files, about 1 GB if it links them
  - Private server: Tailscale or Radmin VPN on your PC and your friends' PCs, same network
  - Community server: UDP ports 7777-7781 AND 7877-7881 (the warm spares) open in your
    provider's firewall. Setup opens them in Windows Firewall for you; a provider panel or a
    router needs them opened / forwarded by hand.
  - The newest rVclient launcher

OPTIONAL: CHECK YOUR MACHINE FIRST (2 minutes, changes nothing)
  Right-click Host-Check.ps1 > Run with PowerShell. It rates CPU, RAM, disk and network.

SET IT UP
  1. Private server: in your rVclient launcher open Server Status > My private servers >
     "Set up a private server" and keep the code it shows (valid 30 minutes).
  2. Double-click Setup-RVServer.bat. It asks a few things:
       - which drive to put the server on (it suggests your game's drive)
       - your setup code (private) or your Discord name (community - so we can reach you)
       - Copy or link your game files:
           C = copy (recommended) - the server gets its own copy, fully separate
           L = link - no extra space, the same files on disk; the server only reads them
     Then accept the administrator prompt (firewall rules + optional auto-start).
  3. Done.
       Private: your server shows in your launcher under My private servers - press Join.
                Friends on your Tailscale / Radmin network see it there too and can pick it
                as their region. Use "Share..." to add friends by their rVclient name.
       Community: it is registered and WAITING FOR APPROVAL. Once approved it joins
                matchmaking by itself - nothing else to do.

YOUR GAME STAYS YOURS
  Setup never moves or changes your game. It keeps starting from the rVclient launcher as
  always - also while your own server is running.

WHAT YOUR SERVER DOES BY ITSELF (community servers)
  - Warm spare: every Battle Royale mode has a second server ready on port + 100. One lobby is
    open at a time; the moment a match launches, the next lobby opens on the other server, so
    players never wait for a reboot.
  - Auto barge countdown: the lobby countdown follows how fast players arrive - busy = longer,
    so lobbies fill toward 40 players; quiet = 120 s, so nobody waits long for nobody.
  - Memory saving and bots on teams (Duos / Trios / Squads) - fixes by MCha.

MANAGING YOUR SERVER
  The "rV Modes (server)" shortcut on your desktop: switch modes on/off, restart a mode, see
  your review status, update. The gear button has each mode's settings: bots per match, barge
  countdown, Warm spare server, Auto barge countdown (shortest / longest), Memory saving,
  Bots on teams and more.
  Updates come by themselves - you never download server files again by hand. After an update,
  restart rV Modes' servers (or reboot) once so the warm spares start.

REMOVING IT
  Private server: Server Status > My private servers > Remove (on the PC that runs it).
  Any server: run Uninstall-RVServer.bat in the server's folder (for example C:\RVServer).
  It asks first whether to KEEP the server installed (stopped, files kept for next time) or
  remove everything. Either way your game is checked and left normal.

HELP
  Ask in the rVclient Discord. Never share your server folder's setup-state.json - it holds
  your server's key.
